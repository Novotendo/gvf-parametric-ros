# GVF Parametric ROS

This package is a **singularity-free guiding vector field for robot navigation**. It varies from other vector-field guided path-following (VF-PF) algorithms in the next ways:

* It is  a novel method to transform self-intersected or simple closed desired paths to non-self-intersected and unbounded counterparts in a higher dimensional space.

* This approach is a combining extension of both conventional VF-PF and trajectory tracking algorithms.

* Global convergence to the desired paths, which could be even self-intersected, is rigorously guaranteed.
