# GVF Parametric ROS

This package is a **singularity-free guiding vector field for robot navigation**. It varies from other vector-field guided path-following (VF-PF) algorithms in the next ways:

* It is  a novel method to transform self-intersected or simple closed desired paths to non-self-intersected and unbounded counterparts in a higher dimensional space.

* This approach is a combining extension of both conventional VF-PF and trajectory tracking algorithms.

* Global convergence to the desired paths, which could be even self-intersected, is rigorously guaranteed.

* Spline-curve waypoints interpolation to follow any defined path.

* Tight ROS integration.

Installation Instructions - Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic
---------------------------------------------------------
To use this package, please install first ![ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu/). In addition, you will also need the ![catkin-tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html) package. Then, you can continue the gvf-parametric package installation as follows:

1. If you don't have a ROS workspace yet you can do so by:
```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin init
$ catkin config --extend /opt/ros/melodic
$ catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ catkin config --merge-devel
```

2. Get the turtlebot simulator and additional dependencies:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone git@github.com:ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
$ git clone git@github.com:catkin/catkin_simple.git
```

3. Now clone the gvf-parametric package:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Novotendo/gvf-parametric-ros.git
```

4. Build your workspace and source:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin build
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

Basic Usage
-----------
Launch the simulation with a turtlebot model, in our case the Burger, in an empty world:
```
$ roslaunch gvf_parametric sim_gvf_parametric_2d_spline.launch
```
The launch file includes a node that automatically publish an example self-intersected trajectory. This is only for testing, you can comment this node in the launch file and build your own pipeline! :D
